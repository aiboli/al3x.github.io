h1. About The Author

My full name is Alexander Francis Payne. I go by Alex. I've used the handle "al3x" for over ten years around the Internet, where I'm now perhaps better recognized by it. At the time of writing I'm twenty-five. I've lived in San Francisco's "SoMa":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_Market neighborhood since mid-2007. Previously, I lived for most of my life around Washington, DC, particularly in Bethesda, Maryland.

I currently work for "Twitter, Inc.":http://twitter.com, a communications service that allows users to send short one-to-many messages via a variety of media. My title at Twitter is Platform Lead; my daily work is growing and supporting a collection of services on which other developers can build. I've been working at Twitter since the beginning of 2007, several months before the service began to grow in popularity. It's been an education in scaling, performance optimization, and systems architecture, not to mention all the joys and stresses that come with a successful startup company.

Before working at Twitter I've done information security work for a military and intelligence contractor, built web applications for political campaigns and non-profits, and more. As you might guess given those jobs, my professional interest has largely been in web application development and computer security. I've been working in technology since before I was old enough to legally hold a work permit; my first internship was at age twelve.

I do a fair bit of "speaking":http://al3x.net/books_talks.html on technical topics I'm interested in. Additionally, a sort of work-related hobby I study the design and implementation of programming languages comparatively. This hobby turned into a side-project in the form of "Programming Scala":http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155964, co-authored with "Dean Wampler":http://deanwampler.com and published by O'Reilly Media in September 2009. Though the book was a lot of work, I'm eager for my next large writing project.

Technology aside, my interests are music, food & drink, and culture. I'm a fan of good beer, cocktails, spirits, and short-pull espresso. I enjoy cooking and cuisine. In my free time I frequent museums and theater, and I try to keep up on books and films. I maintain an "online scrapbook":http://minima.soup.io of minimalist art, design, architecture, and technology.

In terms of social ideology, I identify as a "secular humanist":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_Humanism. I'm an agnostic. Politically, I'm a registered independent; my politics are closest to that of "The Economist":http://www.economist.com/ newspaper: mildly Libertarian, fiscally conservative, socially liberal where it's practical and pragmatic, cautiously globalist.

h1. About This Site

I write here. I write on no particular schedule and about no definite range of topics. My posts range in length from a single sentence to several printed pages. More often than not, I write about technology, culture, music, travel, and ideas, punctuated with accounts of major goings-on in my life.

This site has gone through many iterations over the years. Before its incarnation as a weblog, "al3x.net":http://al3x.net was a portfolio for my early attempts at web and graphic design, maintained by hand and updated via FTP. I eventually migrated the site to an early version of "Blogger":http://blogger.com and began updating more frequently.

In 2002 I redesigned the site as a blog, powered by an early version of "Blosxom":http://www.blosxom.com/ running on my university's servers. Subsequently, I've tried just about every major blogging software package out there and written my own in various languages and frameworks. There's no practical reason for switching blogging software so often, save that it makes for enjoyable tinkering. Of all the free blogging software I've used, I've been most satisfied with "Blogger":http://blogger.com.

I currently host this weblog on "GitHub":http://github.com using their "Pages":http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages feature and "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master static site generation system. This lets me completely customize the layout and design of the site, edit posts in my text editor of choice, and store everything in Git, the revision control system I trust. I outsource email and instant messaging for the domain to "Google Apps":http://google.com/a.

I subsidize the hosting costs of this site by placing ads on the front page and beside individual posts. Currently, those ads are provided by the good people at "Fusion Ads":http://fusionads.net/.
