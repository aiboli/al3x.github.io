h1. The Author

My full name is Alexander Francis Payne. I go by Alex. I've used the handle "al3x" for over ten years around the Internet, hence the domain. I grew up around Washington, DC, and I've lived in San Francisco, Portland (Oregon), and New York City. I currently reside in "Venice, Los Angeles":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice%2C_Los_Angeles with my girlfriend, "Nicole Brodeur":http://nicoleabrodeur.com/, and "two very bad kitties":https://vine.co/v/hOqqnWB7KrQ. I travel a lot, too.

I am a programmer and writer.

As of February, 2014 I work at <a href="http://dobt.co/">The Department of Better Technology</a>. We make software that makes government work better.

In May, 2010 I joined "Simple":https://www.simple.com/. Simple is building the future of personal finance, starting with a fee-free, customer-friendly, beautifully designed online banking service. I served as CTO at Simple until July of 2012, and am now an advisor to the company as well as a happy customer.

Before joining Simple, I worked as an engineer at "Twitter":https://twitter.com, a real-time information network. I joined Twitter as one of its first employees at the beginning of 2007. It was an education in scaling, optimization, and systems architecture, not to mention all the joys and stresses that come with working at a growing startup. I worked primarily on building Twitter's developer platform, and later on the service's backend infrastructure.

Prior to Twitter I did information security work for a military and intelligence contractor, built web applications for political campaigns and non-profits, and did a smattering of other freelance programming and graphic design. I've been working in technology since before I was old enough to legally hold a work permit; I was twelve when I did my first software development internship.

I do a fair bit of "speaking":https://al3x.net/books_talks.html on technical topics I'm interested in. Additionally, as a work-related hobby I study the design and implementation of programming languages. This hobby turned into a side-project in the form of "Programming Scala":http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155964, co-authored with "Dean Wampler":http://deanwampler.com/ and published by O'Reilly Media in September 2009. Currently, I coordinate the annual "Emerging Languages":http://emerginglangs.com/ event, a showcase of new programming languages and implementation techniques.

I spend some of my free time advising and investing in technology-driven startup companies. See the "Disclosure" section below for more.

Technology and business aside, my primary interests are the arts, economics, politics, design, architecture, and cultural criticism. In my free time I frequent museums and theater, and I try to keep up on world news, books, and films. For a time, I maintained an "online scrapbook":http://minima.al3x.net/ that collected the influences of Minimalist art on technology and culture.

I try hard to be healthy despite the sedentary nature of computer work. I practice yoga regularly. I'm a "vegan":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism for both dietary and ethical reasons, and I don't drink alcohol. I rely on an "evidence-based":http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17958117 meditation technique in times of increased stress. I've adopted these routines simply because I feel better when I stick to them.

In terms of social ideology, I identify as a "secular humanist":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_Humanism. On matters of faith, I'm an agnostic. Politically, I'm a registered independent voter (that is, not affiliated with any party or platform).

h1. Disclosure

I write critically about various businesses, organizations, and technologies, so it seems only fair to disclose any potential conflicts of interest I may have:

* I'm an investor in "Datadog":http://www.datadoghq.com/.
* I'm an investor in "Sprint.ly":https://sprint.ly/.
* I'm an investor in "Rainforest":https://www.rainforestqa.com/ via "FundersClub":http://fundersclub.com/.
* I'm an advisor to "Kodowa":http://kodowa.com/, makers of "Light Table":http://www.lighttable.com/.

Some of my investing and advising relationships are no longer active:

* I was an investor in "Lucky Sort":http://luckysort.com/. They have since been acquired.
* I was an advisor to and minor investor in "Simperium":https://simperium.com/. They have since been acquired.
* Through the "Portland Seed Fund":http://portlandseedfund.com/, I was an advisor to "Geoloqi":http://geoloqi.com/. They have since been acquired.
* I was an advisor to the "Portland Incubator Experiment":http://www.piepdx.com/.

h1. The Site

I write here. I write on no particular schedule and about no definite range of topics. My posts range in length from a single sentence to several printed pages. More often than not, I write about technology, culture, music, travel, and ideas, punctuated with accounts of major goings-on in my life.

This site has gone through many iterations over the years. Before its incarnation as a weblog, "al3x.net":https://al3x.net was a portfolio for my early attempts at web and graphic design, maintained by hand and updated via FTP. I eventually migrated the site to an early version of "Blogger":http://blogger.com and began updating more frequently.

In 2002 I redesigned the site as a blog, powered by an early version of "Blosxom":http://www.blosxom.com/ running on my university's servers. Subsequently, I've tried just about every major blogging software package out there and written my own in various languages and frameworks. There's no practical reason for switching blogging software so often, save that it makes for enjoyable tinkering.

I currently host this site on a "Linode VPS":http://www.linode.com/?r=45405878277aa04ee1f1d21394285da6b43f963b. I manage the content and layout with the "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll static site generation system. This lets me completely customize the site, edit posts in my text editor of choice, and "store everything in Git":https://github.com/al3x/al3x.github.com, a version control system I trust.
